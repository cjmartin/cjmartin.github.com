  Anon Kode looks like an open-source alternative to Claude Code, letting you run an AI-powered code assistant with local models like Qwen2.5-Coder via Ollama. I got it installed and running, but hit roadblocks trying to get it to work smoothly. If you've had success with it, message me on Bluesky and let me know!

[Anon Kode](https://github.com/dnakov/anon-kode) looks to be Claude Code that you can use with local models:

> Terminal-based AI coding tool that can use any model that supports the OpenAI-style API.
>
> Fixes your spaghetti code  
> Explains wtf that function does  
> Runs tests, shell commands and stuff  
> Whatever else claude-code can do, depending on the model you use  

Sounds amazing, especially since Claude Code (which is great) is currently _quite_ expensive. It probably should be, but I can't afford dollars-a-day costs for a coding assistant. Can a local version compare?

Here's my experience setting up and using Anon Kode with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [Qwen2.5-Coder 14B](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder) on my 36GB M3 Pro MacBook Pro.

**TL;DR:** I got it working with Ollama and Qwen2.5-Coder, but then failed to successfully work with it and don't have time to debug. If you've had success with Anon Kode please [message me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cjmart.in/post/3lkrf7g3oyc2u) and tell me about it!

## Setup

Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and `ollama run qwen2.5-coder:14b` if you don't have an exsting local LLM set up.

<small>Hiccup: I've been having issues connecting to the Ollama API via localhost because my machine preferrs ipv6 for localhost (::1), and Ollama only binds to ipv4 (127.0.0.1). In my own code I just use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, but the default Ollama configuration for Kode uses localhost, so I "solved" the problem by commenting out the ipv6 entry for localhost in my `/etc/hosts` file. This is not a good solution, but that's a future Chris problem. If anyone knows how to fix this properly, please let me know.</small>

Install and run Kode:

```bash
npm install -g anon-kode
cd your-project
kode
```

I walked through the config screens and picked Ollama as my API Provider:

I set the API KEY to "ollama". This shouldn't be necessary, but it doesn't like it if you don't set an API KEY value.

Pick your model, I chose to pick the same model for "large" and "small".

I went with "Default" for tokens.

Looks good.

Success! "Hello" gets a response from Ollama.

## Use

Now that Kode is talking to Ollama, will it work?

I was half way through writing this post, so I thought I would ask Kode to insert the remaining images above for me. It didn't go well.

Looks like an issue with understanding the project? Maybe running `/init` will help?

ðŸ«  That's unfortunate.

It seems like there are a number of issues; file access, missing tools... unfortunately I don't have time to dig further right now, so it's back to Claude.

## Result (for now)

I _really_ want this to work, and I'll try again when I have time. If you've had more success with Anon Kode please [message me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cjmart.in/post/3lkrf7g3oyc2u) and tell me about it!
