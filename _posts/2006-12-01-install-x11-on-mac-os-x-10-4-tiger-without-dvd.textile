!(alignright)http://files.cjmart.in/images/x11.jpg! The other day I was at school and I needed to install "X11":http://images.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/ on my intel mac in order to run an "NX Client":http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-macosx.php session into my linux box at home.

However, apple doesn't seem to want to put the X11 User package for Tiger online anywhere... You can find the package for &lt;=10.3 but what good is that!?

For anyone like me who doesn't carry their Tiger install DVD at all times, I am going to put the X11 User and X11 SDK packages online.

"You can download them here.":http://idt.lcc.gatech.edu/~cmartin9/files/X11Tiger.zip <small>- zip file ~60MB</small>

If the link above doesn't work: <small>please try above first</small>

"You can download them here.":http://files.cjmart.in/X11Tiger.zip <small>- zip file ~60MB</small>

The .zip file contains 2 packages, X11User.pkg and X11SDK.pkg. I think you need to install the X11SDK.pkg first, however if you have the dev tools installed it's probably already there. After the install run software update as apple has released "an update":http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11update2006113.html for this version of X11.

Enjoy X11.

<strong>Update:</strong> Want to thank me? Leave a comment (many already have, and I love seeing that I have helped people)!

p{margin: 0pt 20px 5px}. <small>Some have suggested that I set up a way for people to leave small donations for my hosting of the files. Here's my idea, why don't you treat yourself and help me out at the same time! Below are a couple links to the amazon product pages for OSX Leopard. If you buy Leopard through one of these links then I get a small amount of money through the Amazon Associates program. The cost to you is the same (actually less than buying Leopard from Apple), and you can help me save money to get myself a copy!</small>

p{margin: 0pt 20px 5px}. <small>Even if you don't want Leopard, use one of these links then buy a book... I'll still get ~10Â¢, Yay!</small>
