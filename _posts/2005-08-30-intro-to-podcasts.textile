I started off this Mobile Media Adventure by cracking open my New Media "toy-box" and pulling out the shiny new -"15in PowerBook":http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html- and the amazing color screen -"60gig iPod":http://www.apple.com/ipod/color/- to dive into this world of "podcasting":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast a little deeper.

I fired up "iTunes":http://www.apple.com/itunes/ on the powerbook, and navigated through the "music store":http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/ to the "podcast section":http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/podcasts.html where I decided to do a search for an enhanced podcast that I could fully enjoy on the color iPod.

My search turned up a few enhanced podcasts to choose from, a few clicks later I was learning about how to make a "shopping cart - go cart hybrid":http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=74069835 with pictures of the process... How Cool!
