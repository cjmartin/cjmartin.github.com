While I've been bumming around trying to get the creative juices flowing by listening to a bunch of other podcasts, [Michael](http://www.gomobilemedia.blogspot.com/) has actually created one - an enhanced one at that!

Thanks Michael for showing me that it can be done... maybe I'll actually think of something to make mine about now.
