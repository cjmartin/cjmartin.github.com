{% include link.html link="https://amzn.to/3FX8WUw" link_text='"Rainbows End" by Vernor Vinge' %}

In the Q&A of [Blaine](https://bsky.app/profile/blaine.bsky.social)'s ATmosphereConf talk [someone made a book recommendation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-H1nzWHLoI&t=33m30s) of [*Rainbows End* by Vernor Vinge](https://amzn.to/3FX8WUw).

I grabbed it on [Libby](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/529076).

I'm not sure how I want to include books here, so I'm just going to start including them. Not sure what I want to do when a book moves from "to read" to "reading" to "read". I'll probably just update this post? If I do that I'll probably filter them out of the main feed.
