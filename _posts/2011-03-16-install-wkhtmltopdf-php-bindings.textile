This isn't a difficult process, but I'm sure I'll need it again, so here it is.

Pre-requisites:
# Download the latest version of libwkhtmltox and the source of wkhtmltopdf "from google code":http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list
# Copy lib/libwkhtmltox.so from libwkhtmltox to /usr/local/lib
# Copy include/wkhtmltox from wkhtmltopdf to /usr/local/include

PHP Bindings:
# Grab php-wkhtmltox "from github":https://github.com/mreiferson/php-wkhtmltox
# Install

Installation:

If development tools aren't installed:
<code>$apt-get install build-essential php5-dev</code> (ubuntu)

<code>
	$phpize
	$./configure
	$make install
</code>

<small>P.S. These instructions are for Ubuntu. If you're on centOS, things are more difficult, good luck.</small>
