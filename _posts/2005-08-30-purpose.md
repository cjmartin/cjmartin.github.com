This blog has been created to track my thoughts, revelations, discoveries, and everything else during my time as a [Mobile Media Scholar](http://www.nmi.uga.edu/mmrl/scholar/index.asp) in the [New Media Institute](http://www.nmi.uga.edu/) at [The University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu) and beyond. Come back often to see what I'm thinking and getting excited about!
