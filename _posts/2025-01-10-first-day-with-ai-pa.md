### What am I talking about?

Earlier this week, I checked a months-overdue item off of my to-do list and set up a very basic "AI Personal Assistant" with [Dan Catt's Kitty AI](https://revdancatt.com/kitty/). In its current form, it simply uses ChatGPT 4 to generate a set of three morning questions, then saves my answers and feeds those back into the prompt on subsequent days. This allows each day's new questions to have some context of my previous answers, and therefore my emotional state, what I'm working on and hoping to achieve, if I've been setting aside time for exercise and rest, etc.

So far, I think it is shockingly great, and I am incredibly excited to use this tool to track what I'm doing, give myself accountability, and develop a routine. Obviously, a script backed by an LLM isn't going to magically make those things happen, but I think it just might be the right thing to _help me_ make those things happen. It's already made a huge impact on my productivity and what I've chosen to do with my time over the last two days (I know, two days... but I'm optimistic!).

Of course, this tool is in the context of what I'm trying to improve personally: mindfulness, organization, goal-setting, and work/personal life separation.

### First Day Experience

On my first day using Kitty, it asked me a question about my emotional state, which I answered with something like:

"I'm feeling anxious that I won't accomplish everything I hope to today, and rushed because I need to get treats to Lucas' school for his birthday."

I was wrapping up getting Kitty running, really wanted to get it done that day, and stressed that I wouldn't. Another question was about what type of short break or activity I could include in my day to recharge, to which I said:

"It would be nice to get a few ski runs in but I don't know if I'll have the time."

As I rushed to Lucas' school to deliver his birthday treats, I turned these answers over in my head. I had initially planned to drop treats off at the school, then head back to a cafe and spend a few more hours on the computer before returning to pick Lucas and Isaac up from school. However, I realized that I would really get more value out of focusing on my son's birthday and celebrating that, than whatever I might accomplish with two more hours staring at the computer.

Instead of rushing in and out for a quick birthday celebration, I signed Lucas and Isaac out for the remainder of the day (a totally normal thing to do; half the school leaves at noon for ski teams), and spent the afternoon skiing with them. I got the activity I needed and made my sons' birthday week that much more special.

Would I have done the same without the questions, responses, and post-thought? I don't know, but I really like the feeling of stopping for a few minutes each morning and being thoughtful, not just rushing into my to-do list.
