I love hack days. I usually go into these things with either no idea, or an idea that's been bubbling in my head and will almost certainly be too ambitious for a day of hacking. Today is the latter, this should be fun.

A few months ago Cal built [http://thisismyj.am](http://thisismyj.am), a parody of [http://thisismyjam.com](http://thisismyjam.com). This triggered the domain-buying lever in my brain and I wound up with [http://thisismycam.com](http://thisismycam.com), which has been parked ever since. The sliver of an idea that inspired the domain purchase is a site that hooks up to Flickr, looks at a user's photos, and builds a profile of all the cameras that they've used. Simple, right?

The plan, pull in photos, check exif, pull in camera info from amazon, build some pretty pages to display it all. Keep an eye on [http://thisismycam.com](http://thisismycam.com) for progress.
