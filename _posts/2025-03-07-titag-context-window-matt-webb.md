This post is going to do some heavy lifting.

1. "Context Window" by Matt Webb is a great talk.
2. Introducing a new section of this site, "Things I Think are Great".
3. Finally figuring out how collections and tags work in Jekyll.

And I only have a few minutes to get started, so I'm going to publish it while it's a work in progress. We'll start with the thing I think is great.
