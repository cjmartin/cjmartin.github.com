  Difficult things becoming easy is not the story here, because on the one hand, we have difficult things become easy; on the other hand, we have easy things become absolutely trivial — and that, for me, is the interesting part.

I'm a few weeks late sharing this. I've been sitting on it and spending too much time thinking about how I want to share links here. I'm still thinking about it...

I really enjoyed this talk, particularly the positive and fun perspective on LLMs and AI. I understand much of the negativity around AI, especially related to funding, business models, etc. — but there are also so many opportunities to build fun and useful things. I think Matt does a great job of shining a light on the positive side of the current AI tools.
