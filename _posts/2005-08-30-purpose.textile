This blog has been created to track my thoughts, revelations, discoveries, and everything else during my time as a -"Mobile Media Scholor":http://www.nmi.uga.edu/mmrl/scholar/index.asp- in the "New Media Institute":http://www.nmi.uga.edu/ at "The University of Georgia":http://www.uga.edu and beyond. Come back often to see what I'm thinking and getting excited about!
