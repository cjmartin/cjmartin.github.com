  ATProto is a massive network, and at least for me, when I saw the initial graph, I was just very confused. I absolutely did not know what I was looking at. But let's start with the base building block… the PDS.

I was looking for more info about AT Protocol from an independent developer perspective, and found this [Software Sessions podcast episode](https://www.softwaresessions.com/episodes/pinksea) featuring [Prefetcher](https://bsky.app/profile/prefetcher.miku.place), where he discusses building [PinkSea](https://pinksea.art) on the AT Protocol.

Around half way through the episide the conversation gets into the technical aspects of his development process, particularly around the AT Protocol's infrastructure, including Personal Data Servers (PDS), relays, app views, the PLC directory, and DIDs. I enjoyed the whole thing, but if you want to jump straight to the AT Protocol technical info, it starts around 32 minutes in.

This is the first Software Sessions podcast I've listened to, and I appreciated the podcast's structured format, which allows for easy navigation between sections, even on CarPlay. If I ever make a podcast again I'll have to include [chapter metadata](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5482-using-chapters-on-apple-podcasts). It's very well done.
