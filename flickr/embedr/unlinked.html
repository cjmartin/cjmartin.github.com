		<p>
			I love hack days. I usually go into these things with either no idea, or an idea that's been bubbling in my head and will almost certainly be too ambitious for a day of hacking. Today is the latter, this should be fun
		</p>

			A few months ago Cal built <a href="http://thisismyj.am">http://thisismyj.am</a>, a parody of <a href="http://thisismyjam.com">http://thisismyjam.com</a>. This triggered the domain-buying lever in my brain and I wound up with <a href="https://thisismycam.com">http://thisismycam.com</a>, which has been parked ever since. The sliver of an idea that inspired the domain purchase is a site that hooks up to Flickr, looks at a user's photos, and builds a profile of all the cameras that they've used. Simple, right?
		</p>

			The plan, pull in photos, check exif, pull in camera info from amazon, build some pretty pages to display it all. Keep an eye on <a href="http://thisismycam.com">http://thisismycam.com</a> for progress.
