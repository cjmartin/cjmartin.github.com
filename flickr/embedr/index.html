			Flickr Web Embed Version 2.0, how does it work?
		</p>

		<p>
			It's easy! Just grab the standard "html" embed code for a flickr photo, it will look like this:
		</p>

{% highlight html %}
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cjmartin/14742549467" title="FlickrHQ Rooftop Lunching by Chris Martin, on Flickr">
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5580/14742549467_2b1878e9fe_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="FlickrHQ Rooftop Lunching"></a>
{% endhighlight %}

		<p>
			And add this extra code to the end:
		</p>

{% highlight html %}
<script async src="//widgets.flickr.com/embedr/embedr.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

		<p>
			The final embed code will look like:
		</p>

{% highlight html %}
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cjmartin/14742549467" title="FlickrHQ Rooftop Lunching by Chris Martin, on Flickr">
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5580/14742549467_2b1878e9fe_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="FlickrHQ Rooftop Lunching"></a>
<script async src="//widgets.flickr.com/embedr/embedr.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

		<p>
			And when entered into a web page, the result is:
		</p>

		<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cjmartin/14742549467" title="FlickrHQ Rooftop Lunching by Chris Martin, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5580/14742549467_2b1878e9fe_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="FlickrHQ Rooftop Lunching"></a><script async src="//widgets.flickr.com/embedr/embedr.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

		<p>
			Below are a few blog posts for reference. The first is where we started, the second is the same with a web embed.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is my opinion that the embed should be "the same, but better." Without interaction it should look like a normal photo in a blog post. On mouse over (and at initial load) all of the extra awesome stuff should appear.
		</p>

		<p>
			Following the test posts are a bunch of different conditions to test the embed.

			I love hack days. I usually go into these things with either no idea, or an idea that's been bubbling in my head and will almost certainly be too ambitious for a day of hacking. Today is the latter, this should be fun

			A few months ago Cal built <a href="http://thisismyj.am">http://thisismyj.am</a>, a parody of <a href="http://thisismyjam.com">http://thisismyjam.com</a>. This triggered the domain-buying lever in my brain and I wound up with <a href="https://thisismycam.com">http://thisismycam.com</a>, which has been parked ever since. The sliver of an idea that inspired the domain purchase is a site that hooks up to Flickr, looks at a user's photos, and builds a profile of all the cameras that they've used. Simple, right?
		</p>

		<p>
			The plan, pull in photos, check exif, pull in camera info from amazon, build some pretty pages to display it all. Keep an eye on <a href="http://thisismycam.com">http://thisismycam.com</a> for progress.
