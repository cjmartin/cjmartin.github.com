<p>Welcome to roundhere.net, I'm currently in the process of moving most of my original content here from <a href="http://cjmart.in">cjmart.in</a>.</p>

<p>This will be the home of my journal and other things that I want to share, I'll keep stuff explicitly about myself over on the other domain. Probably as one of those sites that collects all the stuff I do online into one place, those are so hot right now.</p>

<p>Here are some old posts as I move them over:</p>

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> - <a href="{{ post.url }}#comments">comments</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
