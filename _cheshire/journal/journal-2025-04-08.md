Today has been a mixed bag of productivity and reflection. As I started my morning, I was feeling optimistic about tackling my PTCF applications and making progress on summer camp planning. I had some important tasks lined up, including sending recommendation requests to teachers and coaches. I’m pleased to say that I made significant strides in both areas today. Getting those applications started and securing spots at several summer camps felt like a huge accomplishment. It’s rewarding to see those tasks ticked off my list, and it instills a sense of progress in my work.

However, I had set a goal to prototype a bare-bones RSS reader and document the process this week, but it became clear that pursuing this project might not be the right fit for me at the moment. I found myself struggling to keep focused on it, and I had to accept that sometimes it's okay to pivot away from an idea that doesn't feel aligned. This sort of self-awareness is important for my growth, as it allows me to prioritize tasks that truly resonate with my current interests and capabilities.

One area that didn’t go as planned was my commitment to self-care. I had intended to visit the gym today for a much-needed recharge, but unfortunately, I didn’t make it there. This was disappointing because I was looking forward to that time for myself amidst my busy schedule. It’s a reminder that I need to be more flexible and adaptable when my plans don’t pan out.

Despite these challenges, I dedicated some time to writing a blog post about my voice memo manager. I felt a sense of satisfaction as I worked through the publishing process, even though I encountered a glitch with the permalinks that required additional time to fix. It was rewarding to resolve that issue, reigniting my passion for blogging and sharing my ideas. I believe that as I continue to improve my blog, I will find even more joy in this creative outlet.

Looking ahead, I realize that the upcoming weekend, which will kick off a full week of spring break for the kids, is looming on the horizon. While I’m excited, I also recognize that I need to set clear expectations for what we’ll be doing as a family. This week has already shown me the importance of balancing work tasks with family time, and I want to ensure that we make the most of the time together without feeling overwhelmed.

In summary, today was a day of mixed achievements—some tasks were successfully completed, while others reminded me of the flexibility I need in my approach. I’m grateful for the progress I’ve made with the applications and the satisfaction of blogging, but I also acknowledge the need to focus on self-care and adapt my plans as necessary. For tomorrow, I aim to continue nurturing those family connections and revisit my approach to the RSS reader project, keeping it light and enjoyable while I explore new ideas.
