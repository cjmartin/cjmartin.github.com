Today was a mixed bag, filled with both joy and the usual challenges of balancing family and work. In the morning, I began my day by thinking about how meaningful it would be to connect with my mom by opening the Valentine's gift box she sent for the kids. Gifts really hold sentimental value for her, and I wanted to ensure the kids got the chance to enjoy them and report back their excitement. However, given the busy evening routine with dinner and getting the kids to bed, I decided that it would be better to save that activity for the weekend.

As I dove into my work, I was excited to focus on my personal site. I’ve been enjoying the process, and having the boys sit with me to witness my work yesterday was a beautiful moment, even if it made me feel a little vulnerable. It’s been rewarding to have their support, and I hope to involve them more in the process as we learn together.

The big highlight of my day came unexpectedly when I stumbled upon a logfile from an old backup hard disk. It contained insert statements for all my blog posts from around 2005-2009, and I initially thought they were lost forever. Using some of the remarkable GPT tools, I managed to create a script to extract that data, which felt like I was resurrecting a chapter of my past. This moment brought me immense joy as I thought about reintroducing those memories and stories.

Despite the excitement of the day, I need to acknowledge a couple of tasks that didn’t go as planned. I intended to learn how to scan items into a 3D modeling software with the kids, but after getting engrossed in processing the log data, I didn’t manage to explore that. I’m keeping that goal on my to-do list for the coming days, as I believe it could be a fun and educational experience for all of us.

Today also included a significant win with the architectural review meeting, which went well. Our project was approved with virtually no questions or discussions, marking a major step forward. It feels great to see that progress, as we’re now looking forward to the next steps.

Reflecting on the day, I'm filled with gratitude for the moments that brought joy, from the prospect of reconnecting with my past through my blog to the small wins like getting through the architectural meeting. My focus for the rest of the week will be to ensure I carve out time to open that gift box with the kids and explore 3D modeling, as well as maintain communication with my mom.

In summary, I learned the importance of allowing flexibility in my schedule and the joy of rediscovering old memories. I am grateful for the support of my family, and I’m eager to keep moving forward, both in my personal projects and family connections.
